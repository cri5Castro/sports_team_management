# InsForge SDK Documentation - Overview

## What is InsForge?

Backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform providing:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostgREST API
- **Authentication**: Email/password + OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- **Storage**: File upload/download
- **AI**: Chat completions and image generation (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Functions**: Serverless function deployment
- **Realtime**: WebSocket pub/sub (database + client events)

## Installation

The following is a step-by-step guide to installing and using the InsForge TypeScript SDK for Web applications. If you are building other types of applications, please refer to:
- [Swift SDK documentation](/sdks/swift/overview) for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications.
- [Kotlin SDK documentation](/sdks/kotlin/overview) for Android applications.
- [REST API documentation](/sdks/rest/overview) for direct HTTP API access.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Follow these steps in order

### Step 1: Download Template

Use the `download-template` MCP tool to create a new project with your backend URL and anon key pre-configured.

### Step 2: Install SDK

```bash
npm install @insforge/sdk@latest
```

### Step 3: Create SDK Client

You must create a client instance using `createClient()` with your base URL and anon key:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@insforge/sdk';

const client = createClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-app.region.insforge.app',  // Your InsForge backend URL
  anonKey: 'your-anon-key-here'       // Get this from backend metadata
});

```

**API BASE URL**: Your API base URL is `https://your-app.region.insforge.app`.

## Getting Detailed Documentation

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Fetch Documentation Before Writing Code

InsForge provides official SDKs and REST APIs, use them to interact with InsForge services from your application code.

- [TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/overview) - JavaScript/TypeScript
- [Swift SDK](/sdks/swift/overview) - iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS
- [Kotlin SDK](/sdks/kotlin/overview) - Android and Kotlin Multiplatform
- [REST API](/sdks/rest/overview) - Direct HTTP API access

Before writing or editing any InsForge integration code, you **MUST** call the `fetch-docs` or `fetch-sdk-docs` MCP tool to get the latest SDK documentation. This ensures you have accurate, up-to-date implementation patterns.

### Use the InsForge `fetch-docs` MCP tool to get specific SDK documentation:

Available documentation types:

- `"instructions"` - Essential backend setup (START HERE)
- `"real-time"` - Real-time pub/sub (database + client events) via WebSockets
- `"db-sdk-typescript"` - Database operations with TypeScript SDK
- **Authentication** - Choose based on implementation:
  - `"auth-sdk-typescript"` - TypeScript SDK methods for custom auth flows
  - `"auth-components-react"` - Pre-built auth UI for React+Vite (singlepage App)
  - `"auth-components-react-router"` - Pre-built auth UI for React(Vite+React Router) (Multipage App)
  - `"auth-components-nextjs"` - Pre-built auth UI for Nextjs (SSR App)
- `"storage-sdk"` - File storage operations
- `"functions-sdk"` - Serverless functions invocation
- `"ai-integration-sdk"` - AI chat and image generation
- `"real-time"` - Real-time pub/sub (database + client events) via WebSockets
- `"deployment"` - Deploy frontend applications via MCP tool

These documentations are mostly for TypeScript SDK. For other languages, you can also use `fetch-sdk-docs` mcp tool to get specific documentation.

### Use the InsForge `fetch-sdk-docs` MCP tool to get specific SDK documentation

You can fetch sdk documentation using the `fetch-sdk-docs` MCP tool with specific feature type and language.

Available feature types:
- db - Database operations
- storage - File storage operations
- functions - Serverless functions invocation
- auth - User authentication
- ai - AI chat and image generation
- realtime - Real-time pub/sub (database + client events) via WebSockets

Available languages:
- typescript - JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- swift - Swift SDK (for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS)
- kotlin - Kotlin SDK (for Android and JVM applications)
- rest-api - REST API

## When to Use SDK vs MCP Tools

### Always SDK for Application Logic:

- Authentication (register, login, logout, profiles)
- Database CRUD (select, insert, update, delete)
- Storage operations (upload, download files)
- AI operations (chat, image generation)
- Serverless function invocation

### Use MCP Tools for Infrastructure:

- Project scaffolding (`download-template`) - Download starter templates with InsForge integration
- Backend setup and metadata (`get-backend-metadata`)
- Database schema management (`run-raw-sql`, `get-table-schema`)
- Storage bucket creation (`create-bucket`, `list-buckets`, `delete-bucket`)
- Serverless function deployment (`create-function`, `update-function`, `delete-function`)
- Frontend deployment (`create-deployment`) - Deploy frontend apps to InsForge hosting

## Important Notes

- For auth: use `auth-sdk` for custom UI, or framework-specific components for pre-built UI
- SDK returns `{data, error}` structure for all operations
- Database inserts require array format: `[{...}]`
- Serverless functions have single endpoint (no subpaths)
- Storage: Upload files to buckets, store URLs in database
- AI operations are OpenAI-compatible
- **EXTRA IMPORTANT**: Use Tailwind CSS 3.4 (do not upgrade to v4). Lock these dependencies in `package.json`
- **ENVIRONMENT ISOLATION**: Always use the `getTableName('table_name')` utility for database and storage bucket references. This ensures that Demo/Development data is isolated from Production via suffixes.
- **PREMIUM AESTHETICS**: Maintain the Sharkes design language:
    - **Palette**: Use the Pride gradient tokens for accents and Slate-900 for backgrounds.
    - **Glassmorphism**: Use `glass-panel`, `glass-input`, and `glass-button` classes from `main.css`.
    - **Dynamics**: Utilize backdrop blurs and smooth transitions (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-blob`).

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **sports_team_management** (84 symbols, 132 relationships, 4 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/sports_team_management/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/sports_team_management/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/sports_team_management/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/sports_team_management/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/sports_team_management/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.

## CLI

- Re-index: `npx gitnexus analyze`
- Check freshness: `npx gitnexus status`
- Generate docs: `npx gitnexus wiki`
